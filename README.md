# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [X] Provide a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [X] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 48 business hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Edit this `README.md` file

- [ ] Modify the contents of this `README.md` file. Describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. (Here are two well-constructed examples: [Ajna Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna) and [Maia DAO Ecosystem](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia))
- [ ] Review the Gas award pool amount. This can be adjusted up or down, based on your preference - just flag it for Code4rena staff so we can update the pool totals across all comms channels.
- [ ] Optional / nice to have: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] [This checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746) provides some best practices for Code4rena audits.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Final touches

- [ ] Review and confirm the details in the section titled "Scoping details" and alert Code4rena staff of any changes.
- [ ] Review and confirm the list of in-scope files in the `scope.txt` file in this directory. Any files not listed as "in scope" will be considered out of scope for the purposes of judging, even if the file will be part of the deployed contracts.
- [ ] Check that images and other files used in this README have been uploaded to the repo as a file and then linked in the README using absolute path (e.g. `https://github.com/code-423n4/yourrepo-url/filepath.png`)
- [ ] Ensure that _all_ links and image/file paths in this README use absolute paths, not relative paths
- [ ] Check that all README information is in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Remove any part of this template that's not relevant to the final version of the README (e.g. instructions in brackets and italic)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-gitcoin/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

[ ‚≠êÔ∏è SPONSORS: Are there any known issues or risks deemed acceptable that shouldn't lead to a valid finding? If so, list them here. ]

# Overview

[ ‚≠êÔ∏è SPONSORS: add info here ]

The `IdentityStaking` protocol allows users to stake amount of tokens (GTC) and lock the stake for a specified duration. After the expiration of the locking period, the stake can be withdrawn or locked again for another period.
The stake is considered to be a gurantee of someones reputation. It is a colateral that users put as a gurantee on their or on someone elses reputation.
Users will be able to claim stamps in the Gitcoin Passport application based on the amount of tokens staked on them, and this stamps will count towards their humanity score.
Users who are misbehaving and trying to cheat the Gitcoin Passport mechanism to get higher humanity scores will be punished by having the respective stakes slashed.

The slashing logic is not part of the `IdentityStaking` protocol. The misbehaving users will be identified in an off-chain analysis, and the slashing will be executed by calling the `slash` function of the `IdentityStaking` protocol.

The rules for slashing:

- the slashing will be executed on any staked GTC even if the lock period has expired and the GTC has not yet been withdrawn
- if I have staked GTC on myself, and I have misbehaved, then my stake will be slashed
- if I have staked GTC on other people, and I have misbehaved, then all my stakes on others will be slashed
- if someone else has staked GTC on me, and I have misbehaved, then those particular stakes will be slashed

Slashed GTC will be held in the SC for at least a minimum appeal time (`burnRoundMinimumDuration`), during which time slashed users can appeal the slashing decision. Upon succefull appeal funds can be restored using the `release` function of the `IdentityStaking` protocol.

After the appeal time has ended, funds will be burned using the `lockAndBurn` function from the `IdentityStaking` protocol, which will transfer the funds to a designated burn address.

# Additional Context

- [ ] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [x] Please list specific ERC20 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with. Could be "any" (literally anything, fee on transfer tokens, ERC777 tokens and so forth) or a list of tokens you envision using on launch.
- [x] Please list specific ERC721 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with.
- [x] Which blockchains will this code be deployed to, and are considered in scope for this audit?
- [x] Please list all trusted roles (e.g. operators, slashers, pausers, etc.), the privileges they hold, and any conditions under which privilege escalation is expected/allowable
- [ ] In the event of a DOS, could you outline a minimum duration after which you would consider a finding to be valid? This question is asked in the context of most systems' capacity to handle DoS attacks gracefully for a certain period.
- [x] Is any part of your implementation intended to conform to any EIP's? If yes, please list the contracts in this format:
  - `Contract1`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPX`
  - `Contract2`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPY`

An overview of the logic of identity staking has been covered in the **Overview** section above. Further details of how this was designed is covered in the [readme](./id-staking-v2/README.md) in the `id-staking-v2` folder in the sections:

1. [Appendix A: Slashing Rounds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-gitcoin/blob/main/id-staking-v2/README.md#appendix-a-slashing-rounds)
2. [Appendix B: Slashing in Consecutive Rounds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-gitcoin/blob/main/id-staking-v2/README.md#appendix-b-slashing-in-consecutive-rounds)
3. [Appendix C: Diagrams](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-gitcoin/blob/main/id-staking-v2/README.md#appendix-c-diagrams)

Also gas optimisations and security aspects are outlined here:

1. [Appendix D: Security](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-gitcoin/blob/main/id-staking-v2/README.md#appendix-d-security)

This contract will interact with the GTC ERC-20 contract, as the GTC token will be the token that will be staked. GTC is available on:

- ETH mainnet, the token contract address is: `0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163f`
- Optimism, the token contract address is: `0x1EBA7a6a72c894026Cd654AC5CDCF83A46445B08` (TODO: get confirmation that token address is correct)

The smart contract will be deployed to **ETH Mainnet** and **Optimism**.

The trusted roles are:

- DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE - owner of the SC, authorized to do upgrades
- PAUSER_ROLE - pause / unpause the smart contract
- SLASHER_ROLE - authorized to call the slash function
- RELEASER_ROLE - authorized to release funds frozen for slashing

The smart contract `IdentityStaking` does not need to comply to any EIP.

The compiler version configured is `^0.8.23` (this already uses unchedked loo increments, so we did not have to do explicit unchecked increments).

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)

Our main concern is the safety of the funds in the smart contract:

- users can only withdraw what they deposited (minus the slashed amount)
- only users with SLASHER_ROLE role can slash
- only users RELEASER_ROLE can release
- only DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can assign roles or upgrade the contract

_List specific areas to address - see [this blog post](https://medium.com/code4rena/the-security-council-elections-within-the-arbitrum-dao-a-comprehensive-guide-aa6d001aae60#9adb) for an example_
